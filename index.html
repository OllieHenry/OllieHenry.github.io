<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
    I'm Ollie, a software engineer based in Prague. I've also worked as a data scientist
    and continue to develop my skills in both professions. I graduated from Cambrige in
    2022 with a BA in maths, focused mostly on pure maths. Outside of my professional
    development, most of my learning still focuses on maths.
</p>
<p>
    I grew up in Buckingham; the closest town most people have heard of is Oxford,
    20 miles away. I left to attend Cambridge, then after five years, left England to
    live in the Czech Republic.

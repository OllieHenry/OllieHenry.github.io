<h1>How I got my visa: all the pitfalls</h1>
<p>Last modified 2025-06-10. This page is incomplete but under active development.</p>
<p>
    I ran into a lot of issues when applying for my visa, and I felt the process could have been
    better documented. This article aims to fill in some gaps. To keep things coherent, I'll go
    chronologically through what I did and what I discovered. Naturally, that will not result in a
    chronological account of what I <i>should have</i> done. Therefore, at various points in the
    article, I'll work out what might have been the most efficient way to do each step in this
    process.
</p>

<h2>0. Background (with important info!)</h2>
<p>
    In early 2024 I decided to leave the UK. I told my employer about that decision and asked to
    continue my work remotely, since I liked my job and we already had remote workers. They 
    agreed, but since they didn't have a presence in the Czech Republic, I could not be an employee
    there. Instead, we agreed we'd end my employment before I moved, and
    I would offer consultancy services as an independent contractor.
</p>
<p>
    In August 2024 I started my hunt for a Czech digital nomad visa. If you're reading this page,
    I'm assuming you're trying to apply for the digital nomad scheme (or a Czech business visa)
    yourself, so I won't go into what exactly the scheme is. I was eligible because I'm a UK
    citizen, I work as a software engineer for >1.5x the average Czech salary, and I have a STEM
    degree.
</p>
<p>
    The best documentation I found for the process was on the
    <a href="https://mzv.gov.cz/seoul/en/ko/visas/digitalnomad.html">
        Seoul embassy's page</a>.
    There are two streams: employee and freelancer. Because of the arrangements I described
    above, I chose freelancer. I don't know the details of the employee stream; if you're on it,
    I hope most of what's below still helps you.
</p>
<p>
    On the page I shared above, there is a
    <a href="https://mpo.gov.cz/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/digital-nomad-program--275799/">
        link</a>
    to another page from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade which has some more documents,
    listed at the bottom of the page. I read
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://mpo.gov.cz/assets/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/programs-and-projects/2024/12/Digital-Nomad-EN.pdf">
                Digital Nomad Program (pdf)
            </a>,
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://mpo.gov.cz/assets/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/programs-and-projects/2025/4/Step-by-step---freelancer-EN_5_-_1_.docx">
                Step by step - freelancer (docx)
            </a>, and
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://mpo.gov.cz/assets/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/programs-and-projects/2025/4/FAQ---DN-EN.docx">
                FAQ - Digital Nomad Program (docx)
            </a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The others were either related to employee applicants, or were not relevant yet. The most
    important document was 'Step by step - freelancer'. It lists seven steps, but what you'll
    need to do for this visa falls more naturally into four steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Set up a business in the Czech Republic</li>
        <li>Apply to the digital nomad program</li>
        <li>Apply for a visa</li>
        <li>Finalise your business application</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>1. The first step, but the ninth circle</h2>
<p>
    Dante's descent into Hell began with the first circle. My visa application was more like
    climbing out of Hell, because this first step made all the others look easy. My pet theory is
    this: the Czech government departments I was dealing with on the other steps - the London
    embassy and the digital nomad program - were used to helping clueless foreigners such as
    myself, but on this step, I was dealing with a municipal trade licencing office in Prague,
    so I was fairly expected to act like a Czech. But I'm not a Czech, and neither are you, so
    I hope this section saves you all the time I wasted.
</p>
<p>
    For a freelancer applicant, you need to register a trade. If you're applying to
    the digital nomad program, you'll be offering services in IT or marketing, which are among
    the 'unqualified' trades. That simplifies things, since you don't need to prove to the
    trade office that you're qualified to offer these services, unlike, say, if you were a
    doctor or a lawyer.
</p>
<p>
    The easiest way to register is using the online portal (TODO: link). You have to digitally
    sign your application, either by sending it with some Czech government id, or with a
    downloadable app they offer. As far as I can tell, the app doesn't work. So you need to
    get your hands on some Czech government ID.
</p>

    <h3>1.1. The first pitfall: databoxes and Czech POINTs</h3>
    <p>
        In the Czech Republic, you often need to verify your identity online, especially when
        communicating with the government. It's quite a user-friendly, joined-up system, which is
        very helpful once you're actually signed up to it. The difficult part is getting signed up
        outside of the Czech Republic. There are three main ways of getting verified online:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Your Czech online banking account will often be usable for this.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/">MojeID</a>,
                which seems to be the main one, and a little more powerful than the others.
            </li>
            <li>
                A databox, or
                <a href="https://info.mojedatovaschranka.cz/info/cs/">
                    datov치 schr치nka
                </a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        To get a Czech bank account, you need to prove you're allowed to live in the Czech Republic.
        Well, you're not allowed yet, so that option is out. MojeID seems to be more for Czech
        citizens. There may be a way to get one if you're a foreign national, similar to how you
        get a databox, but I don't know. I used a databox.
    </p>
    <p>
        A databox is like a secure messaging service where you can send and receive documents. It's
        worth warning you that they get deleted after 30 days unless you pay for storage, so if you
        don't pay, make sure you're downloading everything. Like the other methods, you'll need to
        verify your identity to open a databox, and there's a way for foreigners to do this: the
        Czech POINT.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is a Czech POINT?
    </p>
    <p>
        A Czech POINT is a physical location, the vast majority of which are in the Czech Republic,
        where you can communicate with the Czech government. They are usually found in Czech post
        offices. There are two in the UK, one in the Czech embassy in London, the other in the
        consulate in Manchester. Your country hopefully has one or two as well. There's a list linked
        at the end of
        <a href="https://mzv.gov.cz/jnp/cz/cestujeme/czech_point/czech_point_kontaktni_misto_verejne.html">
            this page</a>.
        You don't need an appointment if you go to a Czech post office, but your embassy or consulate
        might require one. Even if they have non-appointment times, these are likely to be a couple
        of hours a week and may not be advertised anywhere, so make sure to email them and find out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring your passport to the Czech POINT (this is all about verifying your identity, remember!)
        and ask to set up a databox. It's polite to have memorised the Czech name 'datov치 schr치nka'
        too, in case you're not speaking Czech and they don't know what you mean by 'databox'. They'll
        ask for some basic information to help you set up the account.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was a deeply annoying sub-pitfall here for me. The first-time login details had to be sent
        to you by secure post, either by the Czech postal service making you sign for the letter with ID,
        or with your country's equivalent service. The UK has no such service, so the letter I actually
        received simply told me to return to the Czech POINT to reset my login details. You may be able
        to avoid this fate if you live in a country with a postal service superior to Royal Mail, or if
        you can explain this potential problem at your initial Czech POINT appointment. In fact, the
        databox website's Czech POINT sign-up instructions say that the login details can be sent to your
        email, so I don't know that for sure that any of that had to happen. It's worth making you aware,
        just in case.
    </p>
    <p>
        A databox is useful for more than just verifying your identity. With a Czech POINT, it also
        allows you to
        <a href="https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/sluzby/egovernment/czechpoint/autorizovana-konverze-dokumentu">
            convert
        </a>
        between electronic and paper copies of documents, and each copy so
        obtained has the same legal authority as an original (unless it's a non-copyable document
        like a passport). This is important, because you'll need to submit originals of various
        documents throughout this process. To get a paper document converted to electronic, bring it
        to a Czech POINT, explain what you want, and give them your databox ID. It's worth also
        bringing physical ID<sup>1</sup> just in case. To get an electronic document printed, upload
        the original .zfo<sup>2</sup> file
        <a href="https://www.czechpoint.cz/uschovna/">
            here</a>,
        print the page with the barcode, and bring it to the Czech POINT.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup> In the Czech Republic, ID means your passport or an EU ID card. If you're here,
            you're not an EU resident, so it means your passport. Your country's national ID card may
            also be fine, but your passport definitely is. In the UK, we don't have to carry ID, so
            when we need ID for something like buying alcohol, we tend to use our driving licences. The
            post office might accept your driving licence, but they are within their rights to turn it
            down.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>2</sup> A .zfo is the file type you'll download from databox data messages. It contains
            the actual document (like a PDF) as well as metadata verifying the document. Just giving
            the post office a PDF doesn't tell them that the the document is genuine, so they won't be
            able to convert it for you.
        </p>
    </div>

<p>
    Back to business. Now you have your databox, you can use it to send off your trade application.
    The documents you need are exactly the ones they list: application form, proof you've paid the
    fee, proof you have no criminal record, proof you have permission to use your registered
    office, and so on. They also say you need to prove you're a resident of the Czech Republic.
    That's apparently a catch-22, because you're not, and you won't be unless you register this
    trade. What actually happens is you submit the rest of the application, and they issue a
    'provisional extract from the trade register', which you use for the rest of your visa
    application. When you've got the visa, you go back to the trade office, show them the visa, and
    finalise the application. More on that in section 4. For now, there are some more fun pitfalls.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20px">
    <h3>1.2 ACROs, apostilles, and registered offices</h3>
    <p>
        You may already have some rented accommodation ready in the Czech Republic. You can use that as
        your registered office if you have the landlord's permission, but just providing your lease
        contract to the trade office may not be sufficient proof of this permission. For the Prague 3
        trade office, it wasn't. They had a separate form to be completed by the landlord. You'll need
        to send it to the trade office by post with your case number, or get the original converted to
        electronic form (see pitfall 1.1) to submit it via databox.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other option is to rent a virtual office. There are sites where you pay a small monthly fee
        and immediately have access to a permission letter. This is faster and more convenient, but I
        have nothing to say about the experience of using them, since I got permission from my
        landlord. When I was talking to the Prague 3 trade office, they recommended I use these
        services on account of their speed. Your trade office may be able to recommend a specific
        company. Whoever you use, make sure that any post arriving at the virtual address finds its
        way to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll also need to prove to the trade office that you have no criminal record. There are two
        reasons I bring this up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, your country may have two different criminal record checks
        depending on whether it's for internal use or visa use. For example, the UK has DBS checks for
        internal use, but to get a visa, you submit a different kind of check called an ACRO. The
        trade office may not care which kind you submit, but if you get an ACRO now you can reuse it
        for your visa application, and not have to pay for a DBS check. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, this record
        will need to be translated into Czech or Slovak. If you're also using this translation for your
        visa, it will need to be from an approved translator. I can recommend
        <a href="https://www.absoluteczechtranslations.co.uk/cs/home-czech/">
            Absolute Czech Translations</a>
        if you're in the UK. Again, the trade office may not care whether your
        translation is a proper visa-style one, but it's worth doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, your foreign government documents have no legal power in the Czech Republic. You need
        to certify them for international use, using a verification process known as an apostille. I can
        recommend
        <a href="https://www.hagueapostille.co.uk/">
            Hague Apostille Service</a>
        if you're in the UK. Get your documents apostilled and then translated, because
        the apostille certificate will need to be translated too.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Now that you have your documents in order, you can send them off. You'll need to either post
    originals to the trade office, or get the originals converted in electronic form at a Czech POINT
    and submit them via the databox. You may not be able to add all these documents to the online
    registration form. That's fine - just complete the questions in the form, submit it, and the
    trade office will send you a scary databox message asking you to fix the gaps in your application.
    You can reply with your documents.
</p>
<p>
    As far as I can tell, there's also no way to pay the application fee on the form. Instead, the
    'fix your application' message will tell you you haven't paid, and instruct you to send them a
    bank transfer. They'll tell you what to write in the reference so they know it's from you. But
    they'll only give you the Czech internal bank details, not an international bank account number.
    That means you can't do the transfer from your foreign bank account (unless your bank is a lot
    more helpful than mine). I used Wise to do the transfer, and to make sure the trade office knew
    I'd sent it, I sent them the transfer receipt.
</p>
<p>
    Once they have all these documents, they should issue your provisional trade licence within five
    working days. You'll then have six months to finalise the application. Be aware that you may
    run into roadblocks I haven't encountered here; each licencing office may have different
    requirements.
</p>

<h2>2. The easy bit, with a couple of caveats</h2>
<p>
    For me, the previous step was by far the hardest. If I stop this article here I'll have done my
    duty. However, there are a few more things I can help with.

## Bio

I'm Ollie, a software engineer based in Prague. I've also worked as a
data scientist and continue to develop my skills in both professions. I
graduated from Cambridge in 2022 with a BA in maths, focused mostly on pure.

I grew up in Buckingham; the closest town most people have heard of is
Oxford, 20 miles away. I left to attend Cambridge, then after five years
(three studying, two working), left England to live in the Czech Republic.

## Projects

For most of the free time I spend working on something, that something
is maths. My interests are mostly in logic and functional analysis. Some
books I'm working through (at vastly different speeds) are:

- _Fast Track to Forcing_ (currently most of my time)
- _An Invitation to Model Theory_ (Kirby)
- _Introduction to Modern Analysis_ (Kantorovitz and Viselter)
- _Moonshine Beyond the Monster_

There are (many!) others I've started work on, but I don't spend enough
time on them to warrant mentioning.

Besides that, I've recently started a
[machine learning theory project](https://github.com/OllieHenry/overparametrized)
which explores overparametrized models.

<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I’m Ollie, a software engineer based in Prague. I’ve also worked as a
data scientist and continue to develop my skills in both professions. I
graduated from Cambridge in 2022 with a BA in maths, focused mostly on pure.</p>

<p>I grew up in Buckingham; the closest town most people have heard of is
Oxford, 20 miles away. I left to attend Cambridge, then after five years
(three studying, two working), left England to live in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>For most of the free time I spend working on something, that something
is maths. My interests are mostly in logic and functional analysis. Some
books I’m working through (at vastly different speeds) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Fast Track to Forcing</em> (currently most of my time)</li>
  <li><em>An Invitation to Model Theory</em> (Kirby)</li>
  <li><em>Introduction to Modern Analysis</em> (Kantorovitz and Viselter)</li>
  <li><em>Moonshine Beyond the Monster</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are (many!) others I’ve started work on, but I don’t spend enough
time on them to warrant mentioning.</p>

<p>Besides that, I’ve recently started a
<a href="https://github.com/OllieHenry/overparametrized">machine learning theory project</a>
which explores overparametrized models.</p>

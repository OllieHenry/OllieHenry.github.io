      <h1>How I got my visa: all the pitfalls</h1>
      <p>Last modified 2025-10-25.</p>
      <p>
        I ran into a lot of issues when applying for my visa, and I felt the
        process could have been better documented. This article aims to fill in
        some gaps. To keep things coherent, I'll go chronologically through what
        I did and what I discovered. Naturally, that will not result in a
        chronological account of what I <i>should have</i> done, but it will at
        least help you plan your application to be more efficient than mine.
      </p>

      <h2>0. Background (with important info!)</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2024 I decided to leave the UK. I told my employer about that
        decision and asked to continue my work remotely, since I liked my job
        and we already had remote workers. They agreed, but since they didn't
        have a presence in the Czech Republic, I could not be an employee there.
        Instead, we agreed we'd end my employment before I moved, and I would
        offer consultancy services as an independent contractor.
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2024 I started my hunt for a Czech digital nomad visa. If
        you're reading this page, I'm assuming you're trying to apply for the
        digital nomad scheme (or a Czech business visa) yourself, so I won't go
        into what exactly the scheme is. I was eligible because I'm a UK
        citizen, I work as a software engineer for >1.5x the average Czech
        salary, and I have a STEM degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best documentation I found for the process was on the
        <a href="https://mzv.gov.cz/seoul/en/ko/visas/digitalnomad.html">
          Seoul embassy's page</a
        >. There are two streams: employee and freelancer. Because of the
        arrangements I described above, I chose freelancer. I don't know the
        details of the employee stream; if you're on it, I hope most of what's
        below still helps you.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the page I shared above, there is a
        <a
          href="https://mpo.gov.cz/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/digital-nomad-program--275799/"
        >
          link</a
        >
        to another page from the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade which has
        some more documents, listed at the bottom of the page. I read
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://mpo.gov.cz/assets/en/foreign-trade/economic-migration/programs-and-projects/2024/12/Digital-Nomad-EN.pdf"

            FAQ - Digital Nomad Program (docx)</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The others were either related to employee applicants, or were not
        relevant yet. The most important document was 'Step by step -
        freelancer'. It lists seven steps, but what you'll need to do for this
        visa falls more naturally into four steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up a business in the Czech Republic</li>
        <li>Apply to the digital nomad program</li>
        <li>Apply for a visa</li>
        <li>Finalise your business application</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>

      <h2>1. The nightmarish first step</h2>
      <p>
        This first step made all the others look easy. My pet theory is this:
        the Czech government departments I was dealing with on the other steps -
        the London embassy and the digital nomad program - were used to helping
        clueless foreigners such as myself, but on this step, I was dealing with
        a municipal trade licencing office in Prague, so I was fairly expected
        to act like a Czech. But I'm not a Czech, and neither are you, so I hope
        this section saves you all the time I wasted.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a freelancer applicant, you need to register a trade. If you're
        applying to the digital nomad program, you'll be offering services in IT
        or marketing, which are among the 'unqualified' trades. That simplifies
        things, since you don't need to prove to the trade office that you're
        qualified to offer these services, unlike, say, if you were a doctor or
        a lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way to register is using the
        <a href="https://rzp.gov.cz/epo-jrf/cs/nove-podani"> online portal</a>.
        Some useful background info can be found
        <a href="https://mpo.gov.cz/en/business/licensed-trades/"> here</a>,
        from the Ministry of Industry and Trade. You have to digitally sign your
        application, either by sending it with some Czech government ID, or with
        a downloadable app they offer. As far as I can tell, the app doesn't
        work. So you need to get your hands on some Czech government ID.
      </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 20px">
        <h3>1.1. The first pitfall: databoxes and Czech POINTs</h3>
        <p>
          In the Czech Republic, you often need to verify your identity online,
          especially when communicating with the government. It's quite a
          user-friendly, joined-up system, which is very helpful once you're
          actually signed up to it. The difficult part is getting signed up
          outside of the Czech Republic. There are three main ways of getting
          verified online:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your Czech online banking account will often be usable for this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/">MojeID</a>, which seems to be
            the main one, and a little more powerful than the others.
          </li>
          <li>
            A databox, or
            <a href="https://info.mojedatovaschranka.cz/info/cs/">
              datová schránka</a
            >
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To get a Czech bank account, you need to prove you're allowed to live
          in the Czech Republic. Well, you're not allowed yet, so that option is
          out. MojeID seems to be more for Czech citizens. There may be a way to
          get one if you're a foreign national, similar to how you get a
          databox, but I don't know. I used a databox.
        </p>
        <p>
          A databox is like a secure messaging service where you can send and
          receive documents. You can also use your databox login to sign up to
          other secure online services, which is what we need it for at the
          moment. It's worth warning you that documents get deleted after 30
          days unless you pay for storage, so if you don't pay, make sure you're
          downloading everything. Like the other methods, you'll need to verify
          your identity to open a databox, and there's a way for foreigners to
          do this: the Czech POINT.
        </p>
        <p>What is a Czech POINT?</p>
        <p>
          A Czech POINT is a physical location, the vast majority of which are
          in the Czech Republic, where you can communicate with the Czech
          government. They are usually found in Czech post offices. There are
          two in the UK, one in the Czech embassy in London, the other in the
          consulate in Manchester. Your country hopefully has one or two as
          well. There's a list linked at the end of
          <a
            href="https://mzv.gov.cz/jnp/cz/cestujeme/czech_point/czech_point_kontaktni_misto_verejne.html"
          >
            this page</a
          >. You don't need an appointment if you go to a Czech post office, but
          your embassy or consulate might require one. Even if they have
          non-appointment times, these are likely to be a couple of hours a week
          and may not be advertised anywhere, so make sure to email them and
          find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bring your passport to the Czech POINT (this is all about verifying
          your identity, remember!) and ask to set up a databox. It's polite to
          have memorised the Czech name 'datová schránka' too, in case you're
          not speaking Czech and they don't know what you mean by 'databox'.
          They'll ask for some basic information to help you set up the account.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a deeply annoying sub-pitfall here for me. The first-time
          login details have to be sent to you by secure post, either by the
          Czech postal service making you sign for the letter with ID, or with
          your country's equivalent service. The UK has no such service, so the
          letter I actually received simply told me to return to the Czech POINT
          to reset my login details. You may be able to avoid this fate if you
          live in a country with a postal service superior to Royal Mail, or if
          you can explain this potential problem at your initial Czech POINT
          appointment. In fact, the databox website's Czech POINT sign-up
          instructions say that the login details can be sent to your email, so
          I don't know for sure that any of that had to happen. It's worth
          making you aware, just in case.
        </p>
        <p>
          A databox is useful for more than just verifying your identity. With a
          Czech POINT, it also allows you to
          <a
            href="https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/sluzby/egovernment/czechpoint/autorizovana-konverze-dokumentu"
          >
            convert</a
          >
          between electronic and paper copies of documents, where each copy so
          obtained has the same legal authority as an original (unless it's a
          non-copyable document like a passport). This is important, because
          you'll need to submit originals of various documents throughout this
          process. To get a paper document converted to electronic, bring it to
          a Czech POINT, explain what you want, and give them your databox ID.
          It's worth also bringing physical ID<sup>1</sup> just in case. To get
          an electronic document printed, upload the original .zfo<sup>2</sup>
          file <a href="https://www.czechpoint.cz/uschovna/"> here</a>, print
          the page with the barcode, and bring it to the Czech POINT.
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px">
          <p>
            <sup>1</sup> In the Czech Republic, ID means your passport or an EU
            ID card. If you're reading this, you're probably not an EU national,
            so it means your passport. Your country's national ID card may also
            be fine, but your passport definitely is. In the UK, we don't have
            ID cards, so we tend to use driving licences if we need to be IDed.
            The post office might accept your driving licence, but they are
            within their rights to turn it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            <sup>2</sup> A .zfo is the file type you'll download from databox
            data messages. It contains the actual document (like a PDF) as well
            as metadata verifying the document. Just giving the post office a
            PDF doesn't tell them that the the document is genuine, so they
            won't be able to convert it for you.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Back to business. Now you have your databox, you can use it to send off
        your trade application. In your application you'll be asked which
        municipal trade office you want to use. Pick one close to where you'll
        be living, because you'll be going there a few days after you arrive in
        the country. The documents you need are exactly the ones they list:
        application form, proof you've paid the fee, proof you have no criminal
        record, proof you have permission to use your registered office, and so
        on. They also say you need to prove you're a resident of the Czech
        Republic. That's apparently a catch-22, because you're not, and you
        won't be unless you register this trade. There also doesn't seem to be a
        separate form for making provisional registrations. What actually
        happens is you submit the rest of the application, and they issue a
        'provisional extract from the trade register', which you use for the
        rest of your visa application. When you've got the visa, you go back to
        the trade office, show them the visa, and finalise the application. More
        on that in section 4. For now, there are some more fun pitfalls.
      </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 20px">
        <h3>1.2. ACROs, apostilles, and registered offices</h3>
        <p>
          You may already have some rented accommodation ready in the Czech
          Republic. You can use that as your registered office if you have the
          landlord's permission, but just providing your lease contract to the
          trade office may not be sufficient proof of this permission. For the
          Prague 3 trade office, it wasn't. They had a separate form to be
          completed by the landlord. You'll need to send it to the trade office
          by post with your case number, or get the original converted to
          electronic form (see pitfall 1.1) to submit it via databox.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other option is to rent a virtual office. There are sites where
          you pay a small monthly fee and immediately have access to a
          permission letter. This is faster and more convenient, but I have
          nothing to say about the experience of using them, since I got
          permission from my landlord. When I was talking to the Prague 3 trade
          office, they recommended I use these services on account of their
          speed. Your trade office may be able to recommend a specific company.
          Whoever you use, make sure that any post arriving at the virtual
          address finds its way to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll also need to prove to the trade office that you have no
          criminal record. There are two reasons I bring this up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, your country may have two different criminal record checks
          depending on whether it's for internal use or visa use. For example,
          the UK has DBS checks for internal use, but to get a visa, you obtain
          a different kind of check called an ACRO. The trade office may not
          care which kind you submit, but if you get an ACRO now you can reuse
          it for your visa application, and not have to pay for a DBS check.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this record will need to be translated into Czech. If
          you're also using this translation for your visa, it will need to be
          from an approved translator. I can recommend
          <a href="https://www.absoluteczechtranslations.co.uk/cs/home-czech/">
            Absolute Czech Translations</a
          >
          if you're in the UK. Again, the trade office may not care whether your
          translation is a proper visa-style one, but it's worth doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, your foreign government documents have no legal power in the
          Czech Republic. You need to certify them for international use, using
          a verification process known as an apostille. I can recommend
          <a href="https://www.hagueapostille.co.uk/">
            Hague Apostille Service</a
          >
          if you're in the UK. Get your documents apostilled and then
          translated, because the apostille certificate will need to be
          translated too.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Now that you have your documents in order, you can send them off. You'll
        need to either post originals (or authorised copies) to the trade
        office, or get the originals converted in electronic form at a Czech
        POINT and submit them via the databox. You may not be able to add all
        these documents to the online registration form. That's fine - just
        complete the questions in the form, submit it, and the trade office will
        send you a scary databox message asking you to fix the gaps in your
        application. You can reply with your documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I can tell, there's also no way to pay the application fee on
        the form. Instead, the 'fix your application' message will tell you you
        haven't paid, and instruct you to send them a bank transfer. They'll
        tell you what to write in the reference so they know it's from you. But
        they'll only give you the Czech internal bank details, not an
        international bank account number. That means you can't do the transfer
        from your foreign bank account (unless your bank is a lot more helpful
        than mine). I used Wise to do the transfer, and to make sure the trade
        office knew I'd sent it, I sent them the transfer receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once they have all these documents, they should issue your provisional
        trade licence within five working days. You'll then have six months to
        finalise the application. Be aware that you may run into roadblocks I
        haven't encountered here; each licencing office may have different
        requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>2. The easy bit, with a couple of caveats</h2>
      <p>
        For me, the previous step was by far the hardest. If I stop this article
        here I'll have done my duty. However, there are a few more things I can
        help with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have your trade licence, you can fill in the application form
        and email it to the digital nomad program with all the other stuff:
        proof of education or experience, proof you have an employment or
        consultancy contract signed, and so on. It's all listed in the links
        above. If there are issues they tend to get back to you quickly and
        explain things well. Also, you can submit documents to them in English,
        and they don't need to be in special digitally signed formats like .zfo.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's just one problem: they're too fast! They'll give you a visa
        interview appointment which will be in the very near future, and if you
        don't have everything ready for it, you won't have time to get it ready
        before the interview. You can reschedule it once, but only once, and the
        new date they give you may not be a convenient one. Save yourself the
        trouble and get everything ready before you send the application to the
        digital nomad program.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Not hard either, but no second chances</h2>

      <p>
        Up until now, every step in the process has allowed you to fix your
        mistakes if you make an incorrect submission. Your visa interview is not
        so flexible: you have to get everything right on the day. There are a
        couple of government websites which list what you need:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example
          <a
            href="https://ipc.gov.cz/en/visa-and-residence-permit-types/third-country-nationals/long-term-visa/long-term-visa-for-the-purpose-of-doing-business/?iqTabs=%7B%220%22%3A1%7D"
          >
            the Ministry of the Interior</a
          >, (this link is specifically for business visas)
        </li>
        <li>
          or
          <a
            href="https://mzv.gov.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/long_stay_visa/long_stay_visa.html"
          >
            the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a
          >
          (this link is for general long-term visas).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They both list essentially the same things, some of which I'll discuss
        below. Keep in mind every document you submit needs to be under 180 days
        old, apart from passports, birth certificates, diplomas and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most documents can be submitted in certified copies (made at a Czech
        POINT). Of course, that does not apply to the non-copyable documents I
        discussed above, nor to <b>documents supporting the purpose of stay</b>.
        That means that if you're submitting an employment or consultancy
        contract, it needs to be an original. If you're a freelancer, submit
        your contract as well as your provisional trade licence. Your embassy
        may allow you to save money on the translations for the contract by only
        translating the first few pages, as long as they have the essential
        details: the parties' names, your singatures, the details of the work
        and pay, et cetera. Make sure you confirm first with your embassy that
        this will be acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <b>proof of your financial means</b>, you may also be able to get a
        partial translation of a bank statement which includes opening and
        closing balances, dates, and your name. This should be cheaper than
        translating each individual transaction, which seems a bit pointless.
        Absolute Czech Translations offered this when I used their services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <b>photos</b> have to be Schengen visa compliant. If you have a
        passport photo machine near you, they should have the option to print
        the correct dimensions for a Schengen visa. Many post offices also offer
        this service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <b>proof of accommodation</b> is usually pretty self-explanatory;
        just make sure it covers the whole period of the visa you've applied
        for. If you can, it's worth making a Czech POINT conversion of your
        rental contract into electronic format, because the original will be
        kept on file by the Czech government, but it may be useful later in the
        Czech Republic as a proof of address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your <b>proof of no criminal record</b> should be an officially
        translated, apostilled ACRO if you're in the UK, not a DBS check. This
        is the issue I discussed in Pitfall 1.2. Your country may have an
        equivalent international criminal record check.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other required documents are simple and I have no helpful advice for
        them. Just make sure you've double- and triple-checked the requirements
        once you have all your documents ready, to make sure you haven't missed
        anything.

        <h3>3.1. Medical insurance</h3>
        <p>
          When you pick up your visa, you'll need to show that you have medical
          insurance covering your whole stay. It needs to be compliant with act
          326/1999 on the residence of foreigners in the Czech Republic. This
          means that, among other requirements, the insurance must cover harm
          caused to you by your own intoxication, and harm caused to yourself
          intentionally. I could not find any insurance which actually seemed to
          cover these. However, plenty of insurance products (like PZVP Plus or
          Exclusive), claim to be fully compliant with the act. Mine, one of
          Maxima's products, states on the insurance certificates that it is
          fully compliant. Maybe there are fine points in the insurance terms or
          in act 326/1999 which I don't fully understand; I'm not a lawyer. All
          this is to say, don't panic if you can't find health insurance which
          you're sure covers intoxication and self-harm. Just make sure the
          insurance company states that their product is compliant with the act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another potentially helpful point is that the embassy may accept your
          GHIC card (or national equivalent). If you want to try that, make sure
          you ask them beforehand!

      <h2>4. Getting to the Czech Republic</h2>

      <p>
        Once you get to the Czech Republic, you need to visit the Foreign Police
        to register your arrival, then finalise your trade licence application
        by bringing the trade office your visa and your provisional
        registration. It needs to be the same municipal trade office which you
        used for your application. Make sure you bring evidence of your medical
        insurance to both appointments just in case. Once you've registered your
        trade fully, you'll have an IČO. This is the registration number for
        your business. You should receive a letter from the social security
        administration within eight days explaining how to pay contributions,
        and you'll need to contact a tax office to set up income tax. Your trade
        office can advise you as to whether you're obligated to sign up to VZP,
        the state medical insurer. If you do sign up, let your private insurance
        know this is why you're cancelling, and they should issue a partial
        refund (prorated for the time you've been insured) if you haven't made a
        claim yet.
      </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 20px">
        <h3>4.1. Strange stamps</h3>

        <p>
          This is a final pitfall which hopefully doesn't apply to you. My trade
          office weren't satisfied with just my visa and asked that I obtain a
          'pobytové razítko' (residence stamp) in my passport. This is a stamp
          from the Ministry of the Interior showing my address in the Czech
          Republic, and can be obtained at the office at Žukovského 888/2, 161
          00 Praha 6-Ruzyně.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd never heard of this stamp and certainly hadn't seen it on any
          trade licencing requirements. The staff at the ministry were just as
          confused as me. But they gave me the stamp, after which the trade
          office issued my licence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        After I got the trade licence, I received a letter asking for 2690 CZK
        to appear in a third-party commercial register. You don't have to
        respond.
      </p>

      <h2>Epilogue</h2>

      <p>
        This is only my experience. I may have made mistakes, and you
        unfortunately may find your own issues which I haven't run into. If any
        of what I've said contradicts official documentation, please believe the
        documentation and not me. As I said above, this article just aims to
        fill in some gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is as far as I've got myself. I'm writing this on 13 June and I got
        to Prague on 1 June, so I'm still awaiting my tax registrations. There
        may be more administrative difficulties I discover, so I'll document
        those in another post if they come up.
      </p>
      <p>Good luck, and enjoy life in the Czech Republic!</p>

        If any links in this article are dead, let me know and I'll try to
        direct you to an up-to-date page. I'm reluctant to use links to

      <h2>An update: tax for freelancers</h2>

      <p>
        I don't know how employees are supposed to pay tax; this section may
        only be helpful to sole traders. There are three taxes I needed to worry
        about, which the trade office may mention to you: income tax, social
        security, and health insurance. As I said, health insurance may not
        apply to you if you have private foreigners' insurance. For income and
        social security, you need to sign up yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        My partner had previously registered as a sole trader and received his
        social security registration letter 20 days later without manually
        signing up. He also contacted the local tax office by email with his IČO
        and received his DIČ, the income tax registration number. I took the
        same approach - emailing the tax office - to no avail.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did get something else in the post, though: a letter telling me my
        databox was ready for activation. Strange, since I already have one.
        Still, I activated this different databox, and waiting for me was an
        extract from the register of persons, recognising me as a foreign sole
        trader. That looked promising - an online identifier associated with my
        sole trader registration. I used this new databox to sign into the
        online tax service, MOJE daně, and sure enough, a DIČ was waiting for me
        on the landing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For social security it was a bit more manual: you need to notify them
        via a
        <a href="https://eportal.cssz.cz/web/portal/tiskopisy">form</a> and send
        it via your databox. They'll respond with a letter telling you how much
        you need to pay in advance (which, if you haven't paid Czech taxes
        before, will probably be nothing).
      </p>
